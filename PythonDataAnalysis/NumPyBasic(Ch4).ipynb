        "- ndarray, an efficient multidimensional array providing fast array-oriented\n",
        "\n",
        "- arithmetic operations and flexible broadcasting capabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Mathematical functions for fast operations on entire arrays of data without having to write loops\n",

        "- Fast array-based operations for data munging and cleaning, subsetting and filtering, transformation, and any other kind of computation\n",
        "\n",

        "- Data alignment and relational data manipulations for merging and joining heterogeneous datasets\n",

        "- Expressing conditional logic as array expressions instead of loops with if-elif-else branches\n",
