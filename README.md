# 🚀 My Machine Learning Journey

Hey there, welcome to my little corner of the internet.  
This isn’t just a repo full of code and notebooks.  
This is my **training ground**. My **discipline test**.  
And maybe, one day, my **proof** that I didn’t just dream about becoming great at ML… I actually put in the work.


## 🌱 Introduction
As of **August 8, 2025**, I’m officially stepping into the world of Machine Learning.  
I’m starting where every great ML journey should — with **Python for Data Analysis**.  
This is where I’ll sharpen my skills in:
- Data manipulation
- Data exploration
- Data preparation

These fundamentals will be the **bedrock** for everything that comes next — from working with **scikit-learn** and **PyTorch** to experimenting with lighter frameworks like **PyLite**.  

Right now, I’m at Day 1.  
In the future, I want to look back at this section and see just how far I’ve come.  
Here’s to building, learning, and pushing forward — one commit at a time.

## 💡 Why I’m Doing This

I want to be **the best I can possibly be** in Machine Learning.  
I want *real skill*. And that means showing up, building, breaking things, and learning from the mess.

This repo will:
- Be a **time capsule** of my growth. I’ll see where I started, what I struggled with, and how far I’ve come.
- Hold me **accountable** — if there are no commits for a while, I know I’m slacking.
- Capture my **milestones** — from my first rough models to my proudest projects.

## 🏋️ The Discipline Part

I know learning isn’t magic. It’s reps. So here’s the deal I’m making with myself:
- **At least one commit a week.** No excuses. Even small progress counts.
- **Clear commit messages.** No “stuff” or “update.” Every commit should tell me what I actually did.
- **Write it down.** Each week, I’ll leave notes in here about what I learned — the wins, the fails, and the “aha” moments.

## 📚 What This Will Become

Over time, this repo should feel like:
- A **portfolio** showing that I can actually *do* this stuff.
- A **cheat sheet** for my future self when I forget how I solved a tricky problem.
- A **story** — not just of projects, but of persistence.
